# Project Overview

*(This project is taken from Coursera Project Network)*

## Objective

We use a pretrained model to classify radio signals with input as spectrogram images. The data consists of spectrogram images, and the targets include categories such as Squiggle, Noises, Narrowband, etc. Furthermore, we apply spectrogram augmentation for the classification task to enhance the spectrogram images. As a result, we will be able to classify radio signals given any 2D spectrogram of radio signal input images.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Collect and preprocess spectrogram images.
   - Label data with target categories (Squiggle, Noises, Narrowband, etc).

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use a pretrained model suitable for image classification tasks.

3. **Augmentation**:
   - Apply spectrogram augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and performance.

4. **Training**:
   - Train the model on the augmented spectrogram images.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on validation data.

5. **Classification**:
   - Use the trained model to classify radio signals from 2D spectrogram input images.

## Outcome

By the end of this project, we will have a model capable of accurately classifying radio signals based on their spectrogram images.
